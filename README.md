# Technical Test Lead

_Senior Software Automation Engineer_ <br>

I excel at transforming quality assurance within organisarions and establishing software automations(for test & business) that are continuously integrated, easy to maintain, highly sustainable & efficient in execution. My main objective is to optimise quality assurance within organisations while reducing costs of certain tasks by automating them as efficiently as possible. I believe automation is necessary not just for testing but for any task that can benefit from it, and I am up to the task. <br>

- For UI automation, I have utilised web components which would greatly reduce repetitive code written in automation projects.
- I have helped over **50 Quality Assurance engineers** working for Getir to **learn test automation** by giving a three weeks long bootcamp on automating web applications. Sessions were captured & are being used to further educate their staff.
